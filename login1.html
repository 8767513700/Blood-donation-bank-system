                <li><h4>Blood Collection:</h4> Blood donation banks collect blood from voluntary donors. These donations are categorized into whole blood or specific blood components, such as red blood cells, plasma, and platelets, depending on the medical requirements.</a></li>
                <li><h4>Testing and Processing:</h4> Donated blood undergoes thorough testing and processing to ensure safety and quality. Tests screen for infectious diseases, blood type, and other factors. Blood components are separated and prepared for distribution.</li>
                <li><h4>Storage:</h4> Blood components are stored in specialized refrigeration units to maintain their integrity and shelf life. Proper temperature control is crucial to prevent spoilage and maintain the effectiveness of blood products.</li>
                <li><h4>Distribution:</h4> Blood donation banks supply hospitals and healthcare facilities with the required blood and blood products. Timely distribution is critical, as blood has a limited shelf life.</li>
                <li><h4>Emergency Services:</h4> Blood banks must be available 24/7 to respond to emergencies and provide blood for patients in critical conditions.</li>
                <li><h4>Donor Recruitment:</h4> Blood banks actively engage in donor recruitment campaigns and events to encourage regular and voluntary blood donations. This includes reaching out to the community, schools, and workplaces.</li>
                <li><h4>Education and Awareness:</h4> They are involved in educating the public about the importance of blood donation, the donation process, and eligibility criteria.</li>
                <li><h4>Eligibility Criteria:</h4> Blood banks establish eligibility criteria for donors, including age, weight, health status, and travel history. Potential donors are screened to ensure the safety of both donors and recipients.</li>
                <li><h4>Volunteers:</h4> Many blood banks rely on volunteers who assist with donor care, data entry, and various administrative tasks.</li>
                <li><h4>Research and Development:</h4> Blood banks may engage in research to advance blood transfusion medicine and improve blood processing and storage techniques.</li>
                <li><h4>Regulatory Compliance:</h4> They are subject to strict regulatory oversight and quality control measures to ensure the safety and effectiveness of blood products.</li>
